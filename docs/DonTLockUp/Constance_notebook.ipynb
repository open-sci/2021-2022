    "### Purpose\n",
    "Citations are always important in scientific research. In the domain of Open Science, the Initiative for Open Citations promotes the availability of data on citations with OpenCitations. *As of March 2021, the fraction of publications with open references has grown from 1% to 87% out of 54.2 million articles with references deposited with Crossref.* ([i4oc.org](https://i4oa.org/))\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find out \n",
    "* about the coverage of articles from open access journals in DOAJ journals as citing and cited articles,\n",
    "* how many citations do DOAJ journals receive and do, and how many of these citations involve open access articles as both citing and cited entities,\n",
    "* as well as the presence of trends over time of the availability of citations involving articles published in open access journals in DOAJ journals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "We used the data available in OpenCitations, such as the Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI). We used the REST API to use the data available in DOAJ and OpenCitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "We revealed that the coverage of open citations in DOAJ can be improved, and that many of these citations involve articles which are not in open access, but that the trend is still increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Originality\n",
    "Our research is valuable for the open access domain, by revealing trends on the data of DOAJ. In the future more questions can be build on our research.*"

    "\n",
    "It was relatively difficult to answer all of the questions since we have not actually started the research, but it allowed us to think about whihc specific aspects to take into account once we start the project in order to make it compliant to Open Science standards and requirements. \n",
    "We first started filling the Horizon Europe template, but due to some bug that didn't allow us to submit it, we had to use Horizon 2020 and refill it entirely.\n",
