    "**Some insights on the video titled:**[\"Let's talk about...Open Science Infrastructure with Peter Suber\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwSoFKFCjic&ab_channel=SPARCEurope)\n",
    "\n",
    "Peter Suber admits that the open access infrastructure is a broad term and he uses a specific phrase in order to desribe it:*\"software running on hardware\"*. According to Suber after the pandemic, the importance of the open access became more visible and the demand has increased. He thinks that this is a permanent trend rather than a temporal one. One problematic issue he highlights is the growing demand for open access is not following for the open access infrastructures. This is because some libraries are not aware of the link between open content and open access infrastructures. Therefore, they prefer to pay for content directly, rather than an infrastructure that can provide much more open content. In the opinion of Suber, there are two risks that an unsupported infrastructure can face. They may be closed or purchased by a private company.\n",

    "**insights on the video titled:**[\"Let's talk about.... Open Science Infrastructure with Kaitlin Thaney\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFk2hbtwmqU&ab_channel=SPARCEurope)\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaitlin Thaney, describes open infrastructures as a series of systems of open services, protocols and software that research and scholarship relying on. Both Thaney and Suber use the same example in order to stress the importance of the open infrastructures, they liken the open infrastructures to infrastructures like the roads and bridges we use in our daily lives. We need open access infrastructures for moving, transporting and accessing the data. Open Access Infrastructures are the main channels for making science open and accessible to all.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Thaney, the balance between non-profit institutes and commercial organizations is important. An important aspect for future development is mapping the opportunities to expand resources. Understanding the mechanisms and relationships between infrastructures and funding organizations is essential.\n",
