At the beggining we were just working with the articles dump from DOAJ but then we noticed that there were some different informations about the journals in the journals dump. Like different issn and eissn, we decided to base our \"truth\" in the journals dump. We also discovered that many of the articles in the articles dump did not have a DOI: we decided to put them all in a separate json. "
