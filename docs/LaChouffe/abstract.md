# Availability of Open Citations from Open Journals in Crossref
## Abstract
### Purpose
With the spread of data in the public domain, the relative advantage of holding data in closed databases has diminished. On the other hand, the data on open citations has innumerable advantages. They can improve the transparency and robustness of the analysis of science, improve science policy decision making, stimulate downstream commercial activity, and increase the discoverability of scientific articles. Thus, once sparsely populated, public domain citation databases are growing exponentially. This inquiry is therefore aimed at studying how data of open access articles is treated by Crossref, to evaluate the management of data linked to articles (references) and to have an idea of ​​how much the aggregators communicate with each other in terms of information sharing. 
### Approach
Our research involves the articles from Open Access journals in DOAJ and their data on Crossref. We scouted the presence of identifiers of the articles, their presence on Crossref and the availability of their reference lists and the entities responsible for their specification. This analysis was carried out by using the DOAJ public data dump and Crossref's API.
### Findings
The results reveal that, of the 74% of articles with DOI in the DOAJ ata dump, only a small portion of them have relevant information in Crossref, but that most of them have a relevant id. Also, most of the information was given by Crossref itself. (to be completed)
### Originality
Similar studies have been carried out in the DOAJ, but mostly in sectorial disciplines or environments such as [sociology](https://www.doi.org/10.26761/IJRLS.7.2.2021.1410) and [Publications in India](https://www.doi.org/10.17821/srels/2021/v58i3/152952), as well as analysis of [Application Processing Charges (APCs)](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0165551519837183). The importance of Crossref as the aggregator of metadata has been described in [here](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00022), however our study tries to do a cross-topic and country analysis and comparison.
