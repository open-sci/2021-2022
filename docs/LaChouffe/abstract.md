# Availability of Open Access Metadata from Open Journals – A case study in DOAJ and Crossref 
## Abstract

### Purpose 

With the spread of data in the public domain, Open Access and Open Science practices are becoming central to the scholarly community. They can improve the transparency and robustness of the analysis of science, improve science policy decision making, and increase the discoverability of scientific articles. The databases containing open information about scientific articles have thus grown more and more important. This inquiry is aimed at studying how metadata of open access articles is treated by the DOAJ and Crossref, to evaluate the management of data linked to articles (references) and to understand how aggregators and publishers communicate with each other in terms of information sharing and which variables influence their behaviour.  

### Approach 

Our research involves the articles from Open Access journals in DOAJ and their data on Crossref. We scouted the presence of identifiers of the articles, their presence on Crossref and the availability of their reference lists and the entities responsible for their specification. This analysis was carried out by using the DOAJ public data dump and Crossref's API. 

### Findings 

Our research found that most of articles in the DOAJ is on Crossref, that more than half of the articles have reference lists, and the items of these reference lists about 80% have a DOI, usually asserted by their publisher. However, there are significant differences depending on the journals’ geographical origin, their size in terms of DOIs and in their research fields. 

### Originality 

This project touches on the completeness of data in the DOAJ, as well as its role within the Open Access community. Having a clearer picture of Open Access Publishing is important, as it allows us to identify good practices or flaws in this field. Empirical studies in this niche are lacking and are concentrated on wider issues. 

### Limitations 

This study is limited in scope to the data available on DOAJ. Problems in the original data (e.g. nonstandard DOIs, duplicates and dates) may have influenced the results, as well as the unbalanced presence of DOIs in the fields evaluated.
