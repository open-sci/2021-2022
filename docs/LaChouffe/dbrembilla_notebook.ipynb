Research about the DOAJ\n","\n","In order to write the abstract about our research question, I researched the DOAJ and Crossref.\n","I found the [DOAJ's documentation](https://doaj.org/docs). We could exploit the API to get the article metadata in XML format. It also employs [OpenURLs](https://doaj.org/docs/openurl/). \n","\n","2. Research about Crossref\n","\n","Crossref also has an [API](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/a-non-technical-introduction-to-our-api/) that we can query, but also provides [data dumps](https://www.crossref.org/blog/new-public-data-file-120-million-metadata-records/) that can be accessed, containing json files with the metadata. The source is massive, so we should consider what the best strategy is.\n","If we decide to go with the API, we should consider the fact that we can query it in anonymous, Polite or Plus modes.\n","\n","3. Producing a draft of the abstract\n","\n","I used this information to create a draft for the abstract, that will be completed with the other group members:\n","\n","*\"This research paper inquires how much overlap there is between the articles from Open Access journals in DOAJ and Crossref. Furthermore, we scouted the availability of these articles’ reference lists, the presence of IDs such as DOIs and the entities responsible for their specification. This analysis was carried out by querying the DOAJ and Crossref’s APIs, creating a dataset combining the two. The results reveal that only a small portion(?) of the articles on the DOAJ have relevant information in Crossref, but that most of them have a relevant id (?). Also, most of the information was fiven by Crossref itself(?). This is information is relevant because previous studies were not able to organise this kind of information in an optimal way.\"*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["After talking with my group mates, we improved the abstract:\n","\n","<i>With the spread of data in the public domain, the relative advantage of holding data in closed databases has diminished. On the other hand, the data on open citations have innumerable advantages. They can improve the transparency and robustness of science portfolio analysis, improve science policy decision making, stimulate downstream commercial activity, and increase the discoverability of scientific articles. Thus, once sparsely populated, public domain citation databases passed the 1 billion citation mark in February 2021. This inquiry is therefore aimed at studying how data on open citations are treated by different aggregators and authorities, to evaluate the management of data linked to articles (references) and to have an idea of ​​how much the aggregators communicate with each other in terms of information sharing. Our research involves the articles from Open Access journals in DOAJ and their data on Crossref. We scouted the availability of these articles’ reference lists, the presence of IDs such as DOIs and the entities responsible for their specification. This analysis was carried out by querying the DOAJ and Crossref’s APIs, creating a dataset combining the two. The results reveal that only a small portion of the articles on the DOAJ have relevant information in Crossref, but that most of them have a relevant id. Also, most of the information was given by Crossref itself. This is relevant information because it demonstrates the limits of the aggregators and defines possible solutions to evaluate, and therefore improve, the quality of information shared.</i>\n","\n","And after the teacher's comments, we rewrote the abstract divided into sections."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 4 March week\n","I looked for papers linked to our research question and added them to our shared Zotero and ResearchRabbit.
