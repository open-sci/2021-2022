    "To write our abstract I thought it might be a good idea to figure out how to structure it and which contents to understand.

    "* *Purpose*: This is where you explain ‘why’ you undertook this study. If you are presenting new or novel research, explain the problem that you have solved. If you are building upon previous research, briefly explain why you felt it was important to do so. This is your opportunity to let readers know why you chose to study this topic or problem and its relevance. Let them know what your key argument or main finding is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Study design/methodology/approach*: This is ‘how’ you did it. Let readers know exactly what you did to reach your results. For example, did you undertake interviews? Did you carry out an experiment in the lab? What tools, methods, protocols or datasets did you use? \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Findings*: Here you can explain ‘what’ you found during your study, whether it answers the problem you set out to explore, and whether your hypothesis was confirmed. You need to be very clear and direct and give exact figures, rather than generalise.  It’s important not to exaggerate or create an expectation that your paper won’t fulfill. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Originality/value*: This is your opportunity to provide readers with an analysis of the value of your results. It’s a good idea to ask colleagues whether your analysis is balanced and fair and again, it’s important not to exaggerate. You can also conjecture what future research steps could be. \n",

    "**Purpose ->** \"With the spread of data in the public domain, the relative advantage of holding data in closed databases has diminished. On the other hand, the data on open citations have innumerable advantages. They can improve the transparency and robustness of science portfolio analysis, improve science policy decision making, stimulate downstream commercial activity, and increase the discoverability of scientific articles. Thus, once sparsely populated, public domain citation databases passed the 1 billion citation mark in February 2021. Our research is therefore aimed at studying how data on open citations are treated by different aggregators and authorities, to evaluate the management of data linked to articles (references) and to have an idea of ​​how much the aggregators communicate with each other in terms of information sharing.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Approach ->** \"Our research paper inquires he articles from Open Access journals in DOAJ and Crossref. Furthermore, we scouted the availability of these articles’ reference lists, the presence of IDs such as DOIs and the entities responsible for their specification. This analysis was carried out by querying the DOAJ and Crossref’s APIs, creating a dataset combining the two.\" Bib: \"Davide Notebook\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings ->** \"The results reveal that only a small portion of the articles on the DOAJ have relevant information in Crossref, but that most of them have a relevant id. Also, most of the information was fiven by Crossref itself.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value ->** \"This is relevant information because it demonstrates the limits of the aggregators and defines possible solutions to evaluate, and therefore improve, the quality of information shared.\" "

    "**The citation advantage for open access science journals with and without article processing charges**: Our sample consisted of 1881 journals indexed in DOAJ. Our web-based sources were DOAJ (which covers a huge number of scholarly journals and is among the richest sources of OAJs, with over 11,000 journals on different topics) and Clarivate Analytics. Using ‘Browse Subjects’ in DOAJ (which uses categories based on the Library of Congress Classification system), we selected the ‘Science’ class. Clicking the tree expanded this class to 13 subclasses: astronomy, biology (general), botany, chemistry, geology, human anatomy, mathematics, microbiology, natural history (general), physics, physiology, science (general) and zoology. After selecting each subclass, we used the ‘Journals vs. Articles’ option and limited our search to journals. Since the aim of the study was to determine whether APC or non-APC journals had a citation advantage, we selected from ‘Article processing charges (APCs)’ those journals listed under ‘No’ and then those listed under ‘Yes’ in DOAJ. To verify the availability of journals in the Web of ScienceTM Core Collections, we searched for each title with the ‘Publication Name’ search field. During this process, H-index and average CPP were extracted for each journal. We then verified journal titles in Clarivate Analytics JCR. To enhance the accuracy of our data records, we also recorded each journal’s ISSN. Using JCR, we found the JIF and Quartile Category for journals indexed in DOAJ that, according to the DOAJ classification, charge or do not charge APCs. Our sample was limited by a feature of the Core Collection interface: when a search result returned more than 10,000 records in Web of Science Core Collections, the citation report feature was not available. This was the case for 14 journals, for which we had no access to the H-index of indexed source items. (Of these, three journals had no information about whether they charged APCs or not and so were excluded). It was also not possible to limit our Web of Science Core Collections searches to one calendar year to obtain H-indexes. Consequently, we excluded 11 journals (nine in the APC group and two in the non-APC group) from our research sample. These limitations did not affect our findings. It is noteworthy that the Kruskall–Wallis test at the subclass level showed no significant differences regarding APCs.\n",

    "To determine whether the data were normally distributed, we used the one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. If the distributions were identical, this would support the null hypothesis (H0) according to the Mann–Whitney U test; otherwise the alternative hypothesis is HA: the distributions of scores in the two groups are not equal. To quantify the size of the difference between the two groups, we calculated effect size with the formula r = Z/√N.\n",

    "**Large-scale comparison of bibliographic data sources: Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions, Crossref, and Microsoft Academic**:\n",

    "Crossref. Crossref provides an infrastructure through which scientific publishers make metadata available for the content they publish. We use Crossref data downloaded in August 2018 through the public REST API of Crossref. We downloaded the data in JSON format. The following content types are excluded from our analysis: book-part, book-section, component, data set, journal-issue, peer-review, posted-content, proceedings, proceedings-series, report-series, and standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossref (Hendricks et al., 2020) is a special case. It is a registration agency for DOIs. When a scientific publisher works with Crossref to register a DOI for a document, the publisher provides metadata for this document to Crossref. This metadata is then made openly available by Crossref (with the possible exception of the reference list, for which the publisher determines whether it is made openly available or not). In this way, Crossref has become a bibliographic data source that is of significant interest for bibliometric analyses. The completeness and the quality of the data available in Crossref depend on what publishers provide to Crossref. Crossref itself does not actively collect and enrich data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our matching procedure starts by preprocessing the data obtained from the different data sources. In the case of publication years and volume, issue, page, and article numbers, the preprocessing process retains only numerical characters. All other characters are discarded. The preprocessing process also splits author names in Microsoft Academic into first and last names. In the other data sources, this has already been done by the data provider. In the matching procedure, we treat the first character of the first name of an author as the author’s first initial. The preprocessing process also simplifies document titles, source titles, and author names by converting non-US-ASCII characters into US-ASCII characters, for instance by removing accents.\n",
