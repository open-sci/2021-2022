    "\n",
    "Found an interesting article on the importance of evaluaing accessibility of open data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is thus an unfortunate irony that open-science practices are not equally accessible to all scientists. We often lament the paywalls that make research inaccessible to the reader, but we often do not lament the paywalls, in the form of specific barriers to openness, that prevent many scientists from sharing their work in the first place. Accessibility does not happen by accident, but requires us to intentionally evaluate our work, practices, and organizations to ensure that they are accessible. This evaluation is a constant iterative process—and not a one-off decision—to question whether our new praxis has retained the existing structural inequalities of the one before it.*\n",

    "\"This research paper inquires how much overlap there is between the articles from Open Access journals in DOAJ and Crossref. Furthermore, we scouted the availability of these articles’ reference lists, the presence of IDs such as DOIs and the entities responsible for their specification. This analysis was carried out by querying the DOAJ and Crossref’s APIs, creating a dataset combining the two. The results reveal that only a small portion(?) of the articles on the DOAJ have relevant information in Crossref, but that most of them have a relevant id (?). Also, most of the information was fiven by Crossref itself(?). This is information is relevant because previous studies were not able to organise this kind of information in an optimal way.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- The following is maybea bit ot of out of contex fo us  -->\n",
    "1. **Determine the Research Sponsor Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify the Data to Be Collected:** \\\n",
    "by types, sources, volume and data/file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define How the Data Will Be Organized:**\\\n",
    "Small data volumes can be managed with Excel, while larger data volumes and usage constraints may require the use of relational database management systems (RDBMS) for linked data tables like ORACLE or mySQL, or a Geographic Information System (GIS) for geospatial data layers like ArcGIS, GRASS, or QGIS.\\\n",
    "Therefore, in drafting a DMP, it is most helpful to initially focus on the types and, possibly, names of the products that will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Explain How the Data Will Be Documented**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * First, identify the types of information that should be captured to enable discovery, access, interpretation, useage, and citation of your data. \n",
    "    * Second, determine whether there is a community-based metadata schema or standard, that can be adopted. E.g., variations of *Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Abstract Model*, *ISO* (International Organization for Standardization) for geospatial data. A specific metadata content standard will be recommended by a target data repository, archive, or domain professional organization. \n",
    "    * Third, identify software tools that can be employed to create and manage metadata content (e.g., Metavist, Morpho). Text files (e.g., readme.txt) that include the relevant metadata can be included as headers to the data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A sound documentation strategy can be based on these three steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    "5. **Describe How Data Quality Will Be Assured:** \\\n",
    "It is good practice to describe the QA/QC measures that you plan to employ in your project. Such measures may encompass training activities, instrument calibration and verification tests, double-blind data entry, and statistical and visualization approaches to error detection. Simple graphical data exploration approaches (e.g., scatterplots, mapping) can be invaluable for detecting anomalies and errors.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Present a Sound Data Storage and Preservation Strategy:**\\\n",
    "Many universities and organizations also host institutional repositories, and there are numerous general science data repositories such as [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/), [figshare](http://figshare.com/), and [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/).\n",
    " \n",
    "    * How long will the data be accessible?\n",
    "    * How will data be stored and protected over the duration of the project\n",
    "    * How will data be preserved and made available for future use?\\\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The above questions must be answered in order to decide ho to presere datya in a relient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Define the Project’s Data Policies**:\\\n",
    "Data policies include:\n",
    "    * *Licensing or sharing arrangements* that pertain to the use of preexisting materials\n",
    "    * *Plans for retaining, licensing, sharing, and embargoing* (i.e., limiting use by others for a period of time) data, code, and other materials\n",
    "    * *Legal and ethical restrictions* on access and use of human subject and other sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If preexisting materials, such as data and code, are being used, identify and include a description of the relevant licensing and sharing arrangements in your DMP. Explain how third party software or libraries are used in the creation and release of new software.\n",
    "    Whenever possible, apply standard rights waivers or licenses, such as those established by [Open Data Commons (ODC)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/summary/) and [Creative Commons (CC)](http://creativecommons.org/ ), that guide subsequent use of data and other intellectual products. The CC0 license and the ODC Public Domain Dedication and License, for example, promote unrestricted sharing and data use.\\\n",
    "    Explain how human subject and other sensitive data will be treated (e.g., see http://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/ for information pertaining to human health research regulations set forth in the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Describe How the Data Will Be Disseminated**\\\n",
    "State when, how, and what data products will be made available. Generally, making data available to the greatest extent and with the fewest possible restrictions at the time of publication or project completion is encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Assign Roles and Responsibilities:**\\\n",
    "Roles may include data collection, data entry, QA/QC, metadata creation and management, backup, data preparation and submission to an archive, and systems administration.\\\n",
    "Assign a project team member to revise the plan, reflecting any new changes in protocols and policies. It is good practice to track any changes in a revision history that lists the dates that any changes were made to the plan along with the details about those changes, including who made them.\n",
