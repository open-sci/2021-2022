    "Found an interesting article on the importance of evaluaing accessibility of open data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is thus an unfortunate irony that open-science practices are not equally accessible to all scientists. We often lament the paywalls that make research inaccessible to the reader, but we often do not lament the paywalls, in the form of specific barriers to openness, that prevent many scientists from sharing their work in the first place. Accessibility does not happen by accident, but requires us to intentionally evaluate our work, practices, and organizations to ensure that they are accessible. This evaluation is a constant iterative process—and not a one-off decision—to question whether our new praxis has retained the existing structural inequalities of the one before it.*\n",

    "\"This research paper inquires how much overlap there is between the articles from Open Access journals in DOAJ and Crossref. Furthermore, we scouted the availability of these articles’ reference lists, the presence of IDs such as DOIs and the entities responsible for their specification. This analysis was carried out by querying the DOAJ and Crossref’s APIs, creating a dataset combining the two. The results reveal that only a small portion(?) of the articles on the DOAJ have relevant information in Crossref, but that most of them have a relevant id (?). Also, most of the information was fiven by Crossref itself(?). This is information is relevant because previous studies were not able to organise this kind of information in an optimal way.\"\n",
